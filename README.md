# rusty-emulator

A bunch of emulators written in rust ðŸ¦€ and WebAssembly ðŸ•¸.

See `src/chip8` for implementation.


## z80 emulator

This project aims to create a browser based emulator of the [Zilog Z80][z80-wiki]
microprocessor with handy introspection tools so that you can run and debug
natively assembled code.
